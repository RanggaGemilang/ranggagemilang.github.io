I’m a Data Analyst with a mix of experiences from freelancing at **Bukalapak** to working on **Customer Experience at Style Theory**. I’m really into Data Analysis, Visualization, and Marketing Analytics which are my main areas of interest. I graduated from Algoritma Data Science School, where I got to dive deep into these fields. 

Right now, I’m on the lookout for a job that fits my passion for Marketing Analytics. I’m also open to freelancing opportunities, as I love the flexibility and variety that come with it.
