title: "[Heart Disease Classification](https://rpubs.com/ranggagemilang/heartclassification)"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/datascienceimg/Heart.png'><br>In this project, our goal is to analyze the causes of heart attacks and develop a predictive model for heart disease. We will use the Heart Disease Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes patient data collected from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach.
<br>
<br/>We will use Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes to build predictive models. Afterward, we will compare their performance to determine which model is the most effective. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/RanggaGemilang/Heart-Disease-Classification)<br/>"
