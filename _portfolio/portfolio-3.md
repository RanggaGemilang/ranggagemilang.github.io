title: "[BoardGameGeek Statistics](https://rpubs.com/ranggagemilang/boardgamestats)"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/dataanalysisimg/board.png'><br>[BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) is a testament to how the board game community continues to thrive in the digital age. It’s a place where you can seek game recommendations, clarify rules, and discuss strategies, among other things. Additionally, the site boasts the largest board game collection in existence, with over 100,000 tabletop and board games cataloged. Users can rate games, which impacts their overall rankings.
<br>
<br/>Given the wealth of information available on the site, I’m interested in analyzing and visualizing the website's data to present it in a more engaging and accessible way to understand the history and popularity of Board Games along with its types. You can find the project's article [here](https://rpubs.com/ranggagemilang/boardgamestats) and the code [here](https://github.com/RanggaGemilang/Board-Game-Statistics)<br/>"
