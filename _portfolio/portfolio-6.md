title: "[U.S Drone Strikes](https://ranggagemilang.shinyapps.io/dronestrikes/)"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/dashboard/shinyapps.png'><br>With the rise of drone usage in counterterrorism, debates surrounding their operation have also intensified. When it was revealed that the U.S. used drones for targeted killings outside of official warzones, the body of literature on drone campaigns rapidly expanded. Due to the immediate-action nature of drone operations, this has led to less restrained acts of warfare. Questions about legality, accountability, and, most importantly, transparency have become central to the discourse on drone usage.

<br/>In this Data Analysis Project, I aim to showcase the level of transparency we have and highlight the discrepancies within it while also showcase my skills on using shinyapps as a tools of data visualization. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/RanggaGemilang/Drone-Strikes)<br/>"
