title: "[House Price Prediction with Multiple Regression](https://rpubs.com/ranggagemilang/houseprediction)"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/datascienceimg/HousePrediction.png'><br>In this project, we'll take you through the process of using machine learning to predict housing prices. We'll start with the basics and work our way to a practical example, delving into the intricacies of regression models. Our focus will be on building models to forecast house prices using data that includes features like facilities, materials, floors, and prices.
<br>
<br/>Weâ€™ll use a Linear Regression model due to its simplicity, ease of interpretation, and effectiveness for this type of predictive analysis.. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/RanggaGemilang/House-Price-Prediction)<br/>"
